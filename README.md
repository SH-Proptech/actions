# 🛠️ Actions

This repository contains **custom GitHub Actions** used across the [`sh-proptech`](https://github.com/sh-proptech) organization.

Each action is designed to be reusable, composable, and scoped to a clear purpose — whether for deployment automation, workflow dispatching, notifications, or infrastructure tasks.

> Actions are organized by folder. Each folder contains a `README.md` and a runnable `action.yml`.
